I've been a full-time Linux user and gamer since 2018. I've tinkered with Linux since Valve announced SteamOS in 2013, the company's fork of Debian designed to run in Steam Big Picture Mode at startup. My interest for Linux only grew since then, despite the failure of the Steam Machines.

I was a long-time editor at [Boiling Steam](https://boilingsteam.com), a web site dedicated to Linux gaming, from 2015-2022. I've done [game reviews](https://boilingsteam.com/horizon-zero-dawn-review-with-proton-on-linux/), hardware reviews on laptops from companies like [System76](https://boilingsteam.com/galago-pro-the-lightweight-powerhouse-from-system76/) and [Tuxedo Computers](https://boilingsteam.com/tuxedo-stellaris-the-meanest-laptop-money-can-buy/), voiced a few different opinions, such as [whether Proton (the compatibility layer that allows Windows-based games to run on Linux) has killed native Linux gaming](https://boilingsteam.com/proton-the-native-port-killer/), covered news topics on such things as the [Steam Deck](https://boilingsteam.com/steam-deck-benchmarks-battery-life-and-more/), and so much more.

I also happen to be a freelance script writer for [Gardiner Byrant](https://www.youtube.com/c/GardinerBryant) (formerly known as The Linux Gamer), a popular YouTuber who's been reporting on the Linux gaming scene since 2014. If he's talked about the Steam Deck in one of his videos, chances are I wrote the script for it. [Here's an example](https://youtu.be/Y1Y8dXcQuvI).

Despite the name of the site, it's not exclusively for Linux and Linux gaming. I may *occassionally* touch on console gaming. Like reviews on Nintendo Switch games, for example.

Linux Gaming Central was launched in March of 2022. Please note that *Linux Gaming Central is not affliated with Valve in any way, pattern, or design.*
