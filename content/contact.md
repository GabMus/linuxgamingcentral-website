Interested in contributing? Want to send a review Steam key for your game my way? Have an idea for a logo (I'll pay you for it)? Want to challenge me in *Smash Bros.*? Feedback on the website or my style of writing? Something else? Contact me at linuxgamingcentral@pm.me.

Do note that, if you're sending me a review key, I will *not* always say yes. Here's my preferrable criteria:
- I'm mostly into fighting, survival, and racing games, though I don't mind RPGs or other genres
- I'm not going to review a game with excessive blood or gore
